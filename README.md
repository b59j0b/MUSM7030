Exhibition Analysis Assignment (1000 words)
Drawing on Margaret Lindauer's approach to critical museum visitation, analyse ONE specific aspect of a current Sydney exhibition (you can not review an exhibit from the Chau Chak Wing Museum). You will need to visit the exhibition and either take notes or document the visit on your phone (in some institutions this is not encouraged so be sure to confirm!)
Choose from the following focus areas:
- Display style. and spatial arrangement
- Written texts and unspoken messages
- The construction of the "ideal visitor"
- Museum architecture and its relationship to the exhibition content
Your exhibition review should:
1. Begin with a clear thesis statement about how your chosen aspect shapes visitor experience and meaning-making be sure to set up the institution (briefly) 
2. Support your argument through detailed observations and specific examples from the exhibition (do incldue illustrations, sketches of display design, scans of relevant brochures/screenshots of websites etc) 
3. Consider what is both present and absent in your chosen focus area
4. Connect your exhibition review to broader museological concepts and relevant scholarly literature (this can include literature included from the readings or your own wider reading) 
5. Reflect on how your chosen aspect relates to the exhibition's overall communicative goals
Key questions to consider:
How does your chosen aspect shape visitor experience and meaning making in the exhibition?
Who is the "ideal visitor" constructed through choices embedded in the exhibition?
What is included or excluded through these presentation decisions?
Assessment Criteria:
- Depth of critical analysis rather than broad description
- Clear connection between detailed observations and broader arguments
- Effective use of Lindauer's analytical framework
- Integration of relevant museological literature
- Clear writing and proper academic referencing be sure to bring in some of the readings from week one to support your discussion
You must include one of the following statements within your assignments [does not count towards the word limit]: 
No artificial intelligence of any kind was used in the preparation of this assessment. 
OR
No generative artificial intelligence was used in the preparation of this assessment. The following programs were used for the purposes described [insert description of how you have used it - detail what you asked, how you reviewed etc] 
Some further advice on the use of AI and how you can credit it in your work is below.
For lighter uses of AI, a suggestion like this might suffice:
·   Use of generative artificial intelligence must be appropriately acknowledged. You can do this by  where you need to . This additional description does not add to your word count.
An example of such an acknowledgement that a student may provide might look like:
·   I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) to refine the academic language of my own work. On  I submitted my entire essay () with the prompt to<“Improve the academic tone and accuracy of language, including grammatical structures, punctuation and vocabulary”>. The output () was then modified further to better represent my own tone and style. of writing.
If their use of AI is heavier, a different approach will be needed. This may involve having students document each of their prompt(s), and the process of critiquing and improving the AI output. Guidance is provided here.

Due: Sat Apr 26, 2025 23:59Due: Sat Apr 26, 2025 23:59 
Essay (2500 words 40%) 
Answer one of the following questions in approximately 2,500 words. You must discuss different examples to those dealt with in the first assignment.
1.   Exhibitions are increasingly driven by the role of the visitor. Consider how this shift can be seen in two different exhibitions by comparing the approach of institutions that have attempted to accommodate and include new audiences.
2.   Exhibitions are often about presenting authentic objects in a new context. Looking at two specific examples consider how objects can be a challenge for exhibitions? Your answer could discuss objects in relation to areas such as ethics, loans, conservation, multimedia etc.
3.   Blockbusters are often seen as a populist exhibition format aimed at maximising visitor numbers, in stark contrast to the scholarly collection based exhibition. How are blockbusters currently used by museums? In answering this question you should compare the approach of two exhibitions. You could explore issues such as whether they advance scholarship or reflect popular taste.
4.   According to Gail Dexter Lord, “museum exhibitions are produced through collaboration among professionals from many disciplines.”* What innovations have occurred in the realm of exhibition development in recent years? Discuss in relation to the development of one or two specific exhibitions. (* Gail Dexter Lord (2001), “The Exhibition Planning Process”, in B. Lord  G. Dexter Lord (eds), The Manual of Museum Exhibitions, AltaMira Press, p.1.)
5.   How has the rise of community museums influenced and changed the social and cultural role of exhibitions? Are community driven exhibitions opportunities to display identity or do they also function to create identity? Discuss with reference to two specific examples of community based/driven exhibitions.
Your essay will be marked against the following criteria:
1.   Relevance of answer to question
